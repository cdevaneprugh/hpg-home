This is where settings for the batch system are set. The only settings that should be changed by the user are email settings. The qos settings should ideally be set once by whoever ports the earth model for the group.
In the future, we'd like to have this set so that qos settings are automatically determined, we could also use env vars to set the email address ($USER@ufl.edu).
